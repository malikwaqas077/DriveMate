Firebase Setup (Needed From You)

I cannot create cloud accounts. Please provide:
- Firebase project name
- Google account email to create the project
- Whether you want me to use Firestore in test mode or production mode

Once created, share:
- Firebase project ID
- Web app config (for Flutter Web)
- Android app config (package name + google-services.json)
- iOS app config (bundle ID + GoogleService-Info.plist)

Notes
- I can scaffold the app now and plug in configs when you share them.
